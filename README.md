## Hi there! 👋🏼

**My name is Jin-hoon Chung** and I am a recent **data science** graduate from Flatiron  School. Besides machine learning, I also added to my strength in non-technical communication. I have over 10 years of experience in survey design, data collection, big data cleaning, summary reports compilation, statistical tests, and SAS programming. My expertise is in numbers, data, problem-solving, listening, and time management.

I have decided to become a data scientist because I love expanding my mathematical knowledge. I would love to explore new modern skills and share my experience with others. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Tableu, SQL
- :house_with_garden: Based in Northern Virginia
- 💬 Ask me about sentiment analysis, recommender system, etc
- :door: Open to data science group projects and share skills and stories
